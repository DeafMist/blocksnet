## The purpose of the project

**BlockNet** is an open-source library for generating master plan requirements for urban areas. While achieving the main goal of generating requirements, the library provides more than that:

- Simple yet detailed **city information model** based on city blocks accessibility in graph.
- A **city blocks** generating method.
- Optimized **master plan** generating method provided by **genetic algorithm** according to certain city development **scenario**.
- Fast **provision assessment** method based on normative requirements and linear optimization algorithm.
- Urban territory **parameters balance** based on city development **scenario**.

## Installation

_masterplan_tools_ can be installed with `pip`:

1. `pip install git+https://github.com/iduprojects/masterplanning`

Then use the library by importing classes from `masterplan_tools`. For example:

```python
from masterplan_tools import CityModel
```

For more detailed use case see our [examples](#examples) below.

## Examples

Before running the examples, please, download the [input data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xrLzJ2mcA0Qn7FG0ul8mTkfzKolvUoiP) and place it in `examples/data` directory. You are free to use your own data, but it should match specification classes. Next examples will help to get used to the library:

1. [City blocks generating](examples/1%20blocks_cutter.ipynb) - city blocks generating according to landuse and buildings clustering.
2. [Aggregating city blocks information](examples/2%20data_getter.ipynb) - how to fill blocks with aggregated information and also generate the accessibility matrix between blocks.
3. [City model creation](examples/3%20city_model.ipynb) - how to create the **city model** and visualize it (to make sure it is real and correct).
4. [Linear optimization provision assessment](examples/3a%20city_model%20lp_provision.ipynb) - how to assess provision of certain city service type.
5. [Iterative algorithm provision assessment](examples/3b%20city_model%20iterative_provision.ipynb) - another example of how to assess provision, but using different iterative method.
6. [Genetic algorithm master plan optimization](examples/3d%20city_model%20genetic.ipynb) - how to generate optimized master plans for certain territory or the whole city according to certain scenario.
7. [Balancing territory parameters](examples/3c%20city_model%20balancer.ipynb) - how to increase certain territory population without decreasing the quality of life of the city.

We advice to start with [city model creation](examples/3%20city_model.ipynb) example, if you downloaded the [input data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xrLzJ2mcA0Qn7FG0ul8mTkfzKolvUoiP) we prepared.

## Documentation

We have a [documentation](https://iduprojects.github.io/masterplanning/), but our [examples](#examples) will explain the use cases cleaner.

## Developing

To start developing the library, one must perform following actions:

1. Clone repository (`git clone https://github.com/iduprojects/masterplanning`)
2. (optionally) create a virtual environment as the library demands exact packages versions: `python -m venv venv` and activate it.
3. Install the library in editable mode: `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]' --config-settings editable_mode=strict`
4. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
5. Create a new branch based on **develop**: `git checkout -b develop <new_branch_name>`
6. Add changes to the code
7. Make a commit, push the new branch and create a pull-request into **develop**

Editable installation allows to keep the number of re-installs to the minimum. A developer will need to repeat step 3 in case of adding new files to the library.
