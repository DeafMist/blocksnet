        This method gets city's boundaries from OSM. Then iteratively water, roads and railways are cutted

        For big city it takes about ~ 1-2 hours to split big city's geometry into thousands of blocks.

        or waterways) is computationally expensive. Splitting city by roads and water entities are two the most
        time consuming processes in this method.

        For cities over the Russia it could be better to upload water geometries from elsewhere, than taking
        them from OSM. Somehow they are poorly documented on OSM.
